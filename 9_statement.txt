  9.What is argument, index of a list, and why use add and addAll method in a list.
*/

Argument:
The terms argument and parameter can be used for the same thing: information that are passed into a function.
Example- functionName(argument1, argument2)

Index of a list:
Indexing in list is a way to refer the individual items within an iterable by its position. Index always start with 0.
Example- list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], here list[0] refer to element or value 1 in this list.

Why use add and addAll method in a list:
add method used for adding another element in existing list.
Example- list = [23, 24, 25], now adding for another value or element in this list we can be use add method like this, list.add[26].
         Now list will be list = [23, 24, 25, 26]

addAll method used for adding another list existing list.
Example- list1 = [2, 3, 4] and list2 = [5, 6, 7]
         list1.addAll(list2); now list1 will contain list2 that means list1 = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
